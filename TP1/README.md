Instructions for TP1
========

## Step 1: Create a Copy of This Repo using *Fork*
To finish this TP, you first need to create a copy of this GitHub repository under your own GitHub account. We will use a feature that GitHub provides called *forking*. To do this, you need to
1. **Create your own GitHub account** (if you don't already have one): click on **Sign Up** on this page (if you are not already signed in) then follow the instructions. 
2. **Fork the repo**: sign in with your GitHub account then click on the **Fork** button on the top-right of this page. You will then have a copy of this GitHub repo under your own account (but not yet local on your computer since everything is still on the server of GitHub in remote). For more information on *forking*, you can check [this guide page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/);
3. **Create local copy**: on the webpage of your own repo (NOT the original one at `zhengying-liu/info232`!), click the green button **Clone or download** and copy the URL to clipboard (the URL should be something like `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/info232.git`). Then, open a terminal (Google it if you don't know what it means) on your own computer and type

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mkdir projects
    cd projects/
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/info232.git
    ```
    
Above command lines create a directory `projects/` in your home directory (`~`) and make a local copy (`git clone`) using the URL you just copied. Now you should have a directory at `~/projects/info232` with all materials we need for this TP.
